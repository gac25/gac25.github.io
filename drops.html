					<h3>Contributions</h3>
					<p> I interviewed users about their music application use and observed their interactions creating and managing playlists and browsing for new music. My team and I contributed equally the concept of Drops by synthesizing information from needfinding interviews and conducting a competitive analysis of the information architecture and UI of similar mobile applications. We worked collaboratively in Sketch to design wireframes based on prioritized user scenarios. 
					</p>
					<h3>The Design Problem</h3>
					<p>Our task was to design a mobile music application that improves playlist creation and management. After conducting research, our team reframed the problem to: how can we design an app that allows people to easily find new and unique music to add to their personal playlists? We decided to combine curation of songs by your friends and favorite artists with personalized song recommendations based on your listening history into one experience. You can easily add your favorite songs to your own playlists so you can share them with friends and followers.</p>
