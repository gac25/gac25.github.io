					<h3>Contributions</h3>
					<p> My team and I contributed equally to the generation of the concept of Carity; synthesizing information from needfinding interviews and conducting a competitive analysis of similar mobile applications. I helped with development of rapid paper prototypes and I led user testing of our application; creating and conducting an A/B test, creating a test script and observing user interactions, and conducting a heuristic evaluation.</p>
					<h3>The Design Problem</h3>
					<p>Carity is a mobile web application for people who want to make a difference, but don’t have the time or the money and don’t know where to start. Instead of charities that provide vague descriptions about where your money goes, we allow the selection of specific, actionable causes that clearly show your impact. Our intuitive design allows you to set goals, track progress, and follow through by donating in small & manageable increments to the causes you care about.</p>

				<h1>Figuring Out the Right Problem: Needfinding Interviews</h1>
				<div class="project-right" id="quotes">
					<p >
						“I’m just a poor college student. Is it worth it if I can only donate like a dollar to charities?”
					</p>
					<br>
					<p >
						“I mean I would donate, but I don’t know which charities are available and what exactly my money would be buying.”

					</p>
					

				</div>
				<div>
					<div class="project-left">
						<p>We went out and interviewed people from a variety of backgrounds – undergraduate students, graduate students, and even a few professionals – to get a range of perspectives. We structured our interviews around this question: if we know that people want to donate to charities, what is holding them back from taking action on their resolution?</p>
				
					<p>After synthesizing our research, we found that people want to make a difference in the world, but they don’t have the motivation or money to feel like they can make an impact. We also learned that people who do donate to charities don’t know how their money is exactly being used.</p>

					<h1>Bringing the Concept to Life: Storyboarding User Scenarios</h1>
					<p>Storyboarding allowed us to immerse ourselves in the life experiences and contexts of the people who would use our mobile application. It made us realize the situations where our application could make the most sense in the daily lives of our users, for instance how it could be used in the middle of a busy college student’s schedule.</p>

						<h1>Rapid Usability Testing: Low Fidelity Paper Prototyping</h1>
						<p >We asked other teams to interact with our app and to conduct a heuristic evaluation. By observing their interactions with our prototype, we found they could easily navigate our minimalist design, but they found that the “money” and “days” tabs on the homescreen were confusing. We also found that groups did not know what to do with the view history button. Therefore, we got rid of the “days” tab and got rid of the view history button for our functional prototype.

					<h1>Functional Prototyping and User Testing</h1>
					<p>By observing and interviewing users interacting with our functional prototype, we came to the conclusion that our buttons were too small on the homescreen because they would consistently slip up and not donate the intended amount of money to a cause. We decided to make the button padding bigger and make the colors more distinguishable.</p>
					<p>Users also had trouble finding how to delete a cause from the homescreen, so we decided to conduct an A/B test to figure out if a simple change would lead to more successful deletions. One iteration had the delete button directly on the homescreen in the corner of each cause and the other version had the delete button hidden within the cause details. After running the test on 30 users with Google Analytics, we found that the version with the delete button on the homescreen produced statistically insignificant results compared to the original version with the delete button within the cause details screen, so we decided to keep the original version.</p>

						<h1>Final Product</h1>
						<p >Our final iteration features larger buttons for easier and quicker donation, having all causes above the fold to display all information and eliminate the need to scroll more to donate to another cause.
						</p>

						<p>It was also recognized for best visual design, competing against around 80 other projects. We pitched our application in front of 300 people and 7 judges and presented in more detail in a poster session.
